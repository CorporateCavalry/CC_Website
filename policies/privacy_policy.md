# Privacy Policy

Corporate Cavalry is made in Unity. By default, the game puts you into a group with up to 4 other players in your class.

Your account is linked to an email address that you provide, which we will never use to contact you unless you specifically request after having forgotten your PIN number. This email is stored using Amazon's [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/). Other information which is stored on the database includes your provided display name, how far you and your group have gotten through the game, and any chat messages you send to your group. The database also stores a token which is used to send push notifications to your device. However, if you wish to disable push notifications, this token will not be stored.

All data stored on this database is encrypted both at rest and in transit. Additionally, your data is securely protected and only accessible using your account login credentials.

When the game is complete, your professor will be able to track your progress and contributions by using your email. After a report has been generated, all of your data, including your chat history, email, and device token, are deleted permanently from the database.

If you wish to have your personal data deleted, please contact us at corporatecavalry@gmail.com.
