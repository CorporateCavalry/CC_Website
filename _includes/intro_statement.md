For the next week, starting [start_date], you’ll be playing (game name), a cooperative puzzle game, with three of your classmates. Working well in a team is one of the most important skills in engineering, so (game name) is an opportunity to have fun training these skills.

Your team has been hired by (company name), and must work together to prevent empty water cooler uprisings, (second task), and save your coworkers from the company’s secret project.

Teamwork is vital as the challenges require every member to complete. You’ll be taking turns asynchronously, so strategize together to reach a solution. Clear paths for your teammates, but be wary as the wrong move could just as easily block them.

Before the challenges begin on [start_date], please sign up with your UC Davis Student ID using the following link:
