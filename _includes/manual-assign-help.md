By default, students are randomly assigned their teammates. However, if you would like to manually assign groups, fill out a copy of [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Yoz4oTOIpexApjSwr4CPdSkb6RQKhau42tq27USkGQ/copy).

When you're done, go to File > Download > Comma Separated Values (.csv) to download the file. Be sure to upload before you create the class.

We have also provided [an example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Yoz4oTOIpexApjSwr4CPdSkb6RQKhau42tq27USkGQ/edit#gid=861305919) as reference. Note that groups cannot have more than 4 students.
