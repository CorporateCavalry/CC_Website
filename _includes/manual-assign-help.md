By default, students are randomly assigned teammates. However, if you would like to manually assign groups, follow these steps:

1. Make a copy of [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e-bhXVqwIHhJ9rJZLL0jdAv0-4N__itjqbvBCxEXUfs/copy) in Google Sheets, or [download the template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e-bhXVqwIHhJ9rJZLL0jdAv0-4N__itjqbvBCxEXUfs/export?format=xlsx&gid=0) in Excel.
2. Complete the sheet by assigning each student email with a group number in [this format](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e-bhXVqwIHhJ9rJZLL0jdAv0-4N__itjqbvBCxEXUfs/edit#gid=1751657914). Note that groups cannot have more than 4 students.
3. When you have completed the sheet, export it as a CSV file.
- If you are using Google Sheets, go to File > Download > Comma Separated Values (.csv).
- If you are using Excel, go to File > Save As, then under Browse look for "CSV (Comma delimited)".
4. Upload the CSV file using the box below. Do this before filling out the rest of this page.
