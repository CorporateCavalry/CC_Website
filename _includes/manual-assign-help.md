By default, students are randomly assigned teammates. However, if you would like to manually assign groups, follow these steps:

1. Make a copy of [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e-bhXVqwIHhJ9rJZLL0jdAv0-4N__itjqbvBCxEXUfs/copy).
2. Assign each student with a group number following [this format](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e-bhXVqwIHhJ9rJZLL0jdAv0-4N__itjqbvBCxEXUfs/edit#gid=1751657914). Note that groups cannot have more than 4 students.
3. Go to File > Download > Comma Separated Values (.csv) to download the spreadsheet onto your computer.
