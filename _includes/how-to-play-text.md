Corporate Cavalry is a cooperative puzzle game played with three of your classmates. Working well in a team is one of the most important skills in engineering, so Corporate Cavalry is an opportunity to have fun training these skills.

Your team has been hired by Business Inc., and must work together to prevent empty water cooler uprisings and save your coworkers from the company’s secret project.

Teamwork is vital as the challenges require every member to complete. You’ll be taking turns asynchronously, so strategize together to reach a solution. Clear paths for your teammates, but be wary as the wrong move could just as easily block them.
