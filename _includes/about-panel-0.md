## Making Teamwork Fun

Corporate Cavalry is a cooperative puzzle game played in groups of four, and a fun way for students to develop essential teamwork skills:
- Building on other people's ideas
- Diverse perspectives
- Aligning team goals
- Conflict resolution
- Division of tasks
- Constructive criticism
- Confidence building

Since Corporate Cavalry is a game, not homework, it can be easily added on top of any existing course. However, if desired, students can be graded on participation automatically.

Corporate Cavalry is played asynchronously throughout a week, which supports online learning and fits into any student's schedule.
