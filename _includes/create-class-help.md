Students will be able to start playing the game on the start date, so they should be given a few days beforehand to sign up and install the app. Once the game starts, they will have until the end date to complete the game.

If you would like to manually assign groups, you can upload a CSV file based on [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Yoz4oTOIpexApjSwr4CPdSkb6RQKhau42tq27USkGQ/edit?usp=sharing). Once you have created your spreadsheet, go to File > Download > Comma Separated Values (.csv) to download the file to your computer. Note that groups cannot have more than 4 students.
